    After releasing Pang in late 2019, Polachek was set to tour the record, but was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Polachek stayed in London on begun work on Desire, I Want to Turn Into You with close collaborator Danny L Harle. She considers the album to be a major partnership with Harle, as the record has only a few other collaborators in the mix. She continued work on the album until mid-2021, where she briefly relocated to Barcelona alongside Harle and new collaborator Sega Bodega.`,
