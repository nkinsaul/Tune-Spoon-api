After growing frustrated working within the "DJ-friendly limits" of the Complextro genre he pioneered, Robinson sought to create an album inspired by his nostalgia for Japanese video games and MMORPGs. To achieve this, he employed heavy use of Vocaloids, General MIDI sounds, and guest vocals. Worlds has been regarded as one of the most influential EDM records of the 21st century, with Billboard placing it on their "100 Greatest Albums of the 2010s" list. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Porter+Robinson/Worlds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.',
