        review: `'Honky Château' is packed with classic Elton-John-isms. And by that I mean, it's quintessentially the type of music you'd expect from him. It shines bright with classics "Rocket Man" and "Honky Cat", it features hidden gems "Mellow" and "Salvation", but it also faults on sonic palette and memorability in "Susie (Dramas)" or "Hercules".`,

        review: "What a fantastic album. The songwriting here is just so strong and hooky with that warm 70s sound that I just can't get enough of, and Honky Château lifts my mood evert time. I should have listened to this years ago.",
