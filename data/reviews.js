For some reasons, Ryan keeps recycling the same formula over and over again to the point that I don't expect any refreshment let alone a "wow!" moment. The lack of creativity is very concerning and it seems like he stuck at same corner. Such a shame since he's a talented musician.`,

It shines bright with classics "Rocket Man" and "Honky Cat", it features hidden gems "Mellow" and "Salvation", but it also faults on sonic palette and memorability in "Susie (Dramas)" or "Hercules".`,
